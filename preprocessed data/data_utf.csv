0,"Achalasia  1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:  Achalasia presents with difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), regurgitation of undigested food, chest pain, weight loss, and occasionally, coughing at night. The dysphagia typically occurs with both solids and liquids, and tends to progressively worsen over time.  2. Natural History:  Achalasia is a chronic, progressive disorder. The course of the disease varies, but most patients will experience progressive difficulty in swallowing and worsening regurgitation over time. Treatment can help manage symptoms, but there's no cure for achalasia.  3. Epidemiology:  Achalasia is relatively rare, with an estimated incidence of approximately 1 per 100,000 individuals per year. It affects men and women equally and can occur at any age, but it's more commonly diagnosed in middle-aged or older adults.  4. Etiology:  The exact cause of achalasia is unknown. It's thought to occur when the nerves in the esophagus become damaged, leading to a failure of the esophageal muscles and the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) to function properly. Some theories suggest a viral cause, and there is also a rare familial form suggesting a genetic component.  5. Pathophysiology:  In achalasia, the loss of inhibitory ganglion cells in the myenteric plexus of the esophagus leads to a failure of relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter, and a lack of peristalsis in the esophageal body. This results in the classic symptoms of dysphagia and regurgitation.  6. Differential Diagnosis:  Conditions to consider in the differential diagnosis include esophageal cancer, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), esophageal stricture, and other motility disorders such as diffuse esophageal spasm and nutcracker esophagus.  7. Risk factor/predisposing factor   This condition is caused by damage to the nerves of the esophagus, though the exact reason for this damage is unknown. It may be related to an autoimmune condition or infection.  8. Any Previous Medical History that is related to the disease:  There is no known previous medical history linked to the development of achalasia. It can coexist with autoimmune conditions, but it is not clear if there is a direct correlation."," A 62-year-old woman presents to the clinic with a 6-month history of difficulty swallowing. She describes it as a feeling of food sticking in her chest, and it occurs with both solids and liquids. She also reports instances of undigested food coming back up several hours after eating, and she's noticed a decrease in her weight over the past few months. She has a history of thyroid disease, but no history of gastrointestinal disorders. What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?",Achalasia,48

This results in the classic symptoms of dysphagia and regurgitation.  6. Differential Diagnosis:  Conditions to consider in the differential diagnosis include esophageal cancer, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), esophageal stricture, and other motility disorders such as diffuse esophageal spasm and nutcracker esophagus.  7. Risk factor/predisposing factor   This condition is caused by damage to the nerves of the esophagus, though the exact reason for this damage is unknown. It may be related to an autoimmune condition or infection.  8.

14,"Achalasia  1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:  Achalasia presents with difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), regurgitation of undigested food, chest pain, weight loss, and occasionally, coughing at night. The dysphagia typically occurs with both solids and liquids, and tends to progressively worsen over time.  2. Natural History:  Achalasia is a chronic, progressive disorder. The course of the disease varies, but most patients will experience progressive difficulty in swallowing and worsening regurgitation over time. Treatment can help manage symptoms, but there's no cure for achalasia.  3. Epidemiology:  Achalasia is relatively rare, with an estimated incidence of approximately 1 per 100,000 individuals per year. It affects men and women equally and can occur at any age, but it's more commonly diagnosed in middle-aged or older adults.  4. Etiology:  The exact cause of achalasia is unknown. It's thought to occur when the nerves in the esophagus become damaged, leading to a failure of the esophageal muscles and the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) to function properly. Some theories suggest a viral cause, and there is also a rare familial form suggesting a genetic component.  5.

15,"Acute Pancreatitis  1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:  Acute pancreatitis presents with severe upper abdominal pain which often radiates to the back and is usually accompanied by nausea and vomiting. The pain is typically sudden in onset and may be associated with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension in more severe cases. Physical examination can reveal abdominal tenderness and guarding.   2. Natural History:  Most people with acute pancreatitis recover completely after getting the right treatment. In severe cases, pancreatitis can cause serious complications, such as necrosis, abscesses, or pseudocysts in the pancreas, and systemic complications like acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury, and shock. In about 20% of cases, acute pancreatitis can become severe and lead to death.  3. Epidemiology:  Acute pancreatitis is a fairly common condition, with incidence rates varying from 4.9 to 35 per 100,000 population worldwide, depending on the country and population studied. The incidence has been increasing over time in many countries.  4. Etiology:  The most common causes of acute pancreatitis are gallstones and heavy alcohol use. Other causes can include medications, high triglyceride levels, abdominal trauma, infections, and surgical procedures. In some cases, the cause of acute pancreatitis is never found, and it is referred to as idiopathic.  5. Pathophysiology:  Acute pancreatitis occurs when digestive enzymes become activated while still in the pancreas, irritating the cells of the pancreas and causing inflammation. With ongoing inflammation, the pancreas may become damaged and its function can be impaired, leading to digestion problems and diabetes.  6. Differential Diagnosis:  Differential diagnoses for acute pancreatitis include other causes of abdominal pain such as peptic ulcer disease, acute cholecystitis, acute coronary syndrome, and dissecting aortic aneurysm. It's important to distinguish these conditions as the management strategies differ.  7. Risk factor/predisposing factor   The most common causes are gallstones and heavy alcohol use. Gallstones can cause inflammation by blocking the ducts that lead from the pancreas to the intestines. Heavy alcohol use can cause inflammation by leading to the production of substances that can harm the pancreas. Other causes can include certain medications, high calcium levels in the blood (hypercalcemia), high levels of fat particles in the blood (hypertriglyceridemia), abdominal surgery, certain infections, injury to the abdomen, and certain inherited conditions. Cigarette smoking is also a risk factor for acute pancreatitis, and the risk increases with the number of cigarettes smoked.  8. Any Previous Medical History that is related to the disease:  Previous episodes of acute pancreatitis increase the risk of recurrent pancreatitis.

Epidemiology:  Acute pancreatitis is a fairly common condition, with incidence rates varying from 4.9 to 35 per 100,000 population worldwide, depending on the country and population studied. The incidence has been increasing over time in many countries.  4. Etiology:  The most common causes of acute pancreatitis are gallstones and heavy alcohol use. Other causes can include medications, high triglyceride levels, abdominal trauma, infections, and surgical procedures. In some cases, the cause of acute pancreatitis is never found, and it is referred to as idiopathic.  5. Pathophysiology:  Acute pancreatitis occurs when digestive enzymes become activated while still in the pancreas, irritating the cells of the pancreas and causing inflammation. With ongoing inflammation, the pancreas may become damaged and its function can be impaired, leading to digestion problems and diabetes.  6. Differential Diagnosis:  Differential diagnoses for acute pancreatitis include other causes of abdominal pain such as peptic ulcer disease, acute cholecystitis, acute coronary syndrome, and dissecting aortic aneurysm. It's important to distinguish these conditions as the management strategies differ.  7. Risk factor/predisposing factor   The most common causes are gallstones and heavy alcohol use. Gallstones can cause inflammation by blocking the ducts that lead from the pancreas to the intestines. Heavy alcohol use can cause inflammation by leading to the production of substances that can harm the pancreas. Other causes can include certain medications, high calcium levels in the blood (hypercalcemia), high levels of fat particles in the blood (hypertriglyceridemia), abdominal surgery, certain infections, injury to the abdomen, and certain inherited conditions. Cigarette smoking is also a risk factor for acute pancreatitis, and the risk increases with the number of cigarettes smoked.  8. Any Previous Medical History that is related to the disease:  Previous episodes of acute pancreatitis increase the risk of recurrent pancreatitis. Gallstones and a history of heavy alcohol consumption are major risk factors. Some medical conditions like hypercalcemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and certain autoimmune conditions can increase the risk. Genetic factors also play a role, with certain gene mutations increasing the risk. A history of abdominal trauma or surgery can also predispose to acute pancreatitis. Certain medications have also been associated with pancreatitis."," A 50-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with severe, sharp pain in her upper abdomen that started earlier in the day.

30,"Anal Fissure  An anal fissure is a small tear in the thin, moist tissue (mucosa) that lines the anus.  1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:  Common symptoms of anal fissure include:  - Pain during and after bowel movements (often described as a sharp, searing or burning pain) - Blood on the toilet paper or in the toilet after bowel movement - A visible tear or cut in the anus or anal canal - A small lump or skin tag on the skin near the anal fissure  2. Natural History:  Anal fissures can occur at any age and are often seen in infants and young children since constipation is a common problem in these age groups. While many anal fissures heal on their own or with non-surgical treatment, some fissures may persist and become chronic, requiring surgical intervention.  3. Epidemiology:  Anal fissures are a common condition. They can occur in individuals of all ages, and are equally common in men and women. They are more prevalent in younger adults, and the incidence tends to decrease with age.  4. Etiology:  Anal fissures typically are caused by trauma to the inner lining of the anus. A hard or large stool can cause tiny tears in the anus. Other common causes include:  - Straining during childbirth - Increased tension in the two muscular rings (sphincters) controlling the anus - Chronic constipation or diarrhea - Inflammatory bowel disease - Anal intercourse  5. Pathophysiology:  The exact pathophysiology of anal fissures is not completely understood. The most accepted theory is that an increased anal sphincter pressure contributes to the development of anal fissures. The increased pressure in the internal anal sphincter can reduce blood flow to the anal mucosa, leading to ischemia (lack of blood supply), and ultimately to a tear or fissure.  6. Differential Diagnosis:  Conditions that may present similarly and need to be differentiated from anal fissures include:  - Hemorrhoids - Anal abscess or fistula - Anal cancer - Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis  7. Risk factor/predisposing factor   This can be caused by passing large or hard stools, chronic diarrhea, inflammatory bowel disease, and conditions that affect anal muscle tone.

Other common causes include:  - Straining during childbirth - Increased tension in the two muscular rings (sphincters) controlling the anus - Chronic constipation or diarrhea - Inflammatory bowel disease - Anal intercourse  5. Pathophysiology:  The exact pathophysiology of anal fissures is not completely understood. The most accepted theory is that an increased anal sphincter pressure contributes to the development of anal fissures. The increased pressure in the internal anal sphincter can reduce blood flow to the anal mucosa, leading to ischemia (lack of blood supply), and ultimately to a tear or fissure.  6. Differential Diagnosis:  Conditions that may present similarly and need to be differentiated from anal fissures include:  - Hemorrhoids - Anal abscess or fistula - Anal cancer - Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis  7.

It can occur anywhere in the digestive tract but is most common in the colon. Symptoms may vary depending on the size and location of the lesions, but commonly include:  - Intermittent or chronic bleeding, leading to bloody or dark, tarry stools - Anemia due to blood loss, presenting with symptoms such as fatigue, paleness, and shortness of breath - In severe cases, acute gastrointestinal bleeding  In many cases, angiodysplasia is asymptomatic and only discovered during investigations for other conditions.  2. Natural History:  Angiodysplasia often presents sporadically and may go undiagnosed due to its often asymptomatic nature. It's usually a chronic condition and can persist indefinitely. The natural course of untreated angiodysplasia may include continued or intermittent bleeding.  3. Epidemiology:  Angiodysplasia is more common in older adults, with the prevalence increasing with age.

It's thought to be related to age-related changes in the blood vessels and degeneration of the vessel wall. Other contributing factors may include low blood flow and increased venous pressure in the colon.  5. Pathophysiology:  Angiodysplasia occurs when blood vessels in the mucosa and submucosa of the digestive tract dilate and become abnormally fragile.

60,"Appendicitis  Appendicitis is an inflammation of the appendix, a small pouch that is attached to the beginning of the large intestine.  1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:  The classic symptoms of appendicitis include:  - Dull pain near the navel or the upper abdomen that becomes sharp as it moves to the lower right abdomen. This is usually the first sign. - Loss of appetite - Nausea and/or vomiting soon after abdominal pain begins - Abdominal swelling - Fever of 99-102 degrees Fahrenheit - Inability to pass gas  2. Natural History:  Untreated appendicitis can progress to perforation of the appendix within 24 to 72 hours, leading to peritonitis, an inflammation of the lining of the abdomen, which can be life-threatening. After treatment, which usually involves surgical removal of the appendix, most patients recover without complications.  3. Epidemiology:  Appendicitis is one of the most common causes of severe abdominal pain requiring surgery. It can occur at any age but most often occurs in people between the ages of 10 and 30.   4. Etiology:  The cause of appendicitis relates to blockage of the inside of the appendix, known as the lumen. The blockage leads to increased pressure, impaired blood flow, and inflammation. If the blockage is not treated, gangrene and rupture (breaking or tearing) of the appendix can result.  Blockages may be the result of build-up of thick mucus within the appendix or to stool that enters the appendix from the cecum. The bacterium can multiply rapidly, causing the appendix to become inflamed, swollen and filled with pus, and ultimately leading to appendicitis.  5. Pathophysiology:  When the appendix gets blocked, bacteria within the appendix begin to multiply. This leads to the formation of pus and swelling, which causes pain.

Etiology:  The cause of appendicitis relates to blockage of the inside of the appendix, known as the lumen. The blockage leads to increased pressure, impaired blood flow, and inflammation. If the blockage is not treated, gangrene and rupture (breaking or tearing) of the appendix can result.  Blockages may be the result of build-up of thick mucus within the appendix or to stool that enters the appendix from the cecum. The bacterium can multiply rapidly, causing the appendix to become inflamed, swollen and filled with pus, and ultimately leading to appendicitis.  5. Pathophysiology:  When the appendix gets blocked, bacteria within the appendix begin to multiply. This leads to the formation of pus and swelling, which causes pain. The increased pressure can lead to compromise of the blood supply to the wall of the appendix (ischemia), which can cause the appendix to die (gangrene). Eventually, the appendix can burst or perforate. This can lead to a serious, widespread infection of the abdomen (peritonitis).  6. Differential Diagnosis:  Conditions that may present similarly to appendicitis and need to be differentiated include:  - Ectopic pregnancy - Ovarian torsion - Gastroenteritis - Kidney stones - Urinary tract infection - Gallbladder disease - Crohn's disease  7.

Risk factors are not well understood, but it seems to be more common in males and people aged 10-30.  8. Any Previous Medical History that is related to the disease:  While there is no direct association between certain medical histories and the development of appendicitis, conditions that can mimic its symptoms include previous abdominal surgery, gynecologic disorders, or gastrointestinal diseases. Furthermore, a history of gastrointestinal disorders could potentially increase the risk of developing appendicitis."," A 22-year-old man reports to the emergency department with sharp, severe abdominal pain.

However, many people with celiac disease may have ""non-classical"" or no symptoms, which can include anemia, fatigue, osteoporosis, neurological symptoms (like headaches and peripheral neuropathy), skin rash (dermatitis herpetiformis), and problems related to malabsorption, such as vitamin deficiencies.  2. Natural History:  Celiac disease is a lifelong condition. Symptoms may appear in infancy or much later in life. If left untreated, it can lead to a variety of complications, including malnutrition, lactose intolerance, other autoimmune diseases, osteoporosis, infertility and miscarriage, neurological conditions, and in rare cases, cancer, especially lymphoma.  3. Epidemiology:  Celiac disease is estimated to affect about 1% of the population in Western countries, though many cases are undiagnosed. It can develop at any age after people start eating foods or medicines that contain gluten. The condition tends to be more common in women than men.  4. Etiology:  Celiac disease is caused by an immune reaction to gluten, a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, and rye. It is considered an autoimmune disorder. Genetic factors play a key role, with the disease often running in families. Certain genes (HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8) are known to increase risk.  5. Pathophysiology:  In celiac disease, ingestion of gluten leads to an immune response in the small intestine causing inflammation and damage to the lining of the intestine. Specifically, the villi, small finger-like projections that promote nutrient absorption, are flattened. This damage impairs the absorption of nutrients leading to malnutrition and a variety of other complications.  6.

98,"Celiac Disease  1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:  Celiac disease can present with a variety of symptoms which often vary between individuals. Typical gastrointestinal symptoms include diarrhea, bloating, abdominal pain, and weight loss. However, many people with celiac disease may have ""non-classical"" or no symptoms, which can include anemia, fatigue, osteoporosis, neurological symptoms (like headaches and peripheral neuropathy), skin rash (dermatitis herpetiformis), and problems related to malabsorption, such as vitamin deficiencies.  2. Natural History:  Celiac disease is a lifelong condition. Symptoms may appear in infancy or much later in life. If left untreated, it can lead to a variety of complications, including malnutrition, lactose intolerance, other autoimmune diseases, osteoporosis, infertility and miscarriage, neurological conditions, and in rare cases, cancer, especially lymphoma.  3. Epidemiology:  Celiac disease is estimated to affect about 1% of the population in Western countries, though many cases are undiagnosed. It can develop at any age after people start eating foods or medicines that contain gluten. The condition tends to be more common in women than men.  4. Etiology:  Celiac disease is caused by an immune reaction to gluten, a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, and rye. It is considered an autoimmune disorder. Genetic factors play a key role, with the disease often running in families. Certain genes (HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8) are known to increase risk.  5. Pathophysiology:  In celiac disease, ingestion of gluten leads to an immune response in the small intestine causing inflammation and damage to the lining of the intestine. Specifically, the villi, small finger-like projections that promote nutrient absorption, are flattened. This damage impairs the absorption of nutrients leading to malnutrition and a variety of other complications.  6. Differential Diagnosis:  The differential diagnosis for celiac disease includes other causes of malabsorption like Crohn's disease, microscopic colitis, and short bowel syndrome. Non-celiac gluten sensitivity, irritable bowel syndrome, and wheat allergy can also present similarly.   7. Risk factor/predisposing factor   This is an autoimmune disorder that's triggered by consuming gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. Family history of the disease significantly increases the risk.  8. Any Previous Medical History that is related to the disease:  Having a first-degree relative with celiac disease increases your risk.

Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:  Chronic pancreatitis typically presents with recurrent or persistent abdominal pain, often in the upper abdomen and radiating to the back. Other symptoms can include weight loss due to malabsorption, diarrhea, and steatorrhea (oily or greasy stools) due to inadequate pancreatic enzyme production. As the disease progresses, patients may also develop symptoms related to diabetes, such as increased thirst and urination, due to the damage to insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.  2. Natural History:  Chronic pancreatitis is a progressive disease. Over time, inflammation and fibrosis worsen, leading to permanent damage to the pancreas. This can result in digestive problems due to a lack of pancreatic enzymes, and diabetes due to a lack of insulin. Complications can include pancreatic cysts and calcifications, biliary obstruction, and an increased risk of pancreatic cancer.   3. Epidemiology:  The global prevalence of chronic pancreatitis varies widely, from 5 to 12 per 100,000 population.

Alcohol use is a major risk factor, accounting for up to 70% of cases in some countries.  4. Etiology:  The most common cause of chronic pancreatitis is long-term alcohol abuse. Other causes include gallstones, certain medications, high triglyceride levels, and certain hereditary conditions. In about 20 to 30% of cases, the cause is unknown - this is called idiopathic chronic pancreatitis.  5. Pathophysiology:  Chronic pancreatitis is characterized by chronic inflammation of the pancreas, leading to progressive fibrosis and loss of function of the gland. This is driven by a variety of mechanisms, depending on the cause. For example, in alcohol-induced chronic pancreatitis, toxic metabolites of alcohol cause oxidative stress and cellular injury.  6. Differential Diagnosis:  Differential diagnoses for chronic pancreatitis include conditions such as peptic ulcer disease, gallbladder disease, liver disease, and pancreatic cancer. These conditions can present with similar symptoms, so a careful diagnostic work-up is needed to distinguish them.  7. Risk factor/predisposing factor   Alcoholism and gallstones are the leading causes of acute pancreatitis. Chronic pancreatitis is often linked to heavy alcohol use. Other factors can include certain medications, high calcium levels, high triglyceride levels, and certain autoimmune conditions.  8. Any Previous Medical History that is related to the disease:  A history of acute pancreatitis, especially if associated with alcohol abuse or gallstones, can predispose to chronic pancreatitis. Genetic factors also play a role, with certain gene mutations increasing the risk.

Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:  Chronic pancreatitis typically presents with recurrent or persistent abdominal pain, often in the upper abdomen and radiating to the back. Other symptoms can include weight loss due to malabsorption, diarrhea, and steatorrhea (oily or greasy stools) due to inadequate pancreatic enzyme production. As the disease progresses, patients may also develop symptoms related to diabetes, such as increased thirst and urination, due to the damage to insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.  2. Natural History:  Chronic pancreatitis is a progressive disease. Over time, inflammation and fibrosis worsen, leading to permanent damage to the pancreas.

The incidence is higher in men than in women, and the disease is more common in people in their 30s and 40s. Alcohol use is a major risk factor, accounting for up to 70% of cases in some countries.  4. Etiology:  The most common cause of chronic pancreatitis is long-term alcohol abuse. Other causes include gallstones, certain medications, high triglyceride levels, and certain hereditary conditions. In about 20 to 30% of cases, the cause is unknown - this is called idiopathic chronic pancreatitis.  5. Pathophysiology:  Chronic pancreatitis is characterized by chronic inflammation of the pancreas, leading to progressive fibrosis and loss of function of the gland. This is driven by a variety of mechanisms, depending on the cause. For example, in alcohol-induced chronic pancreatitis, toxic metabolites of alcohol cause oxidative stress and cellular injury.  6. Differential Diagnosis:  Differential diagnoses for chronic pancreatitis include conditions such as peptic ulcer disease, gallbladder disease, liver disease, and pancreatic cancer. These conditions can present with similar symptoms, so a careful diagnostic work-up is needed to distinguish them.  7. Risk factor/predisposing factor   Alcoholism and gallstones are the leading causes of acute pancreatitis. Chronic pancreatitis is often linked to heavy alcohol use. Other factors can include certain medications, high calcium levels, high triglyceride levels, and certain autoimmune conditions.  8. Any Previous Medical History that is related to the disease:  A history of acute pancreatitis, especially if associated with alcohol abuse or gallstones, can predispose to chronic pancreatitis. Genetic factors also play a role, with certain gene mutations increasing the risk. Certain medical conditions like cystic fibrosis, hypercalcemia, and hypertriglyceridemia can also predispose to chronic pancreatitis. Additionally, a history of abdominal trauma or surgery can increase the risk."," A 37-year-old woman who has a known history of autoimmune pancreatitis comes to the clinic complaining of worsening abdominal pain. The pain is located in the upper abdomen and often radiates to her back. She also has been noticing an increase in the amount she drinks and urinates, and despite eating regularly, she has lost weight. Her stools have become oily and sometimes float in the toilet. What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?",Chronic Pancreatitis,59
135,"Colorectal Cancer  1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:  The symptoms of colorectal cancer can include:  - Changes in bowel habits, such as diarrhea, constipation, or narrowing of the stool, that lasts for more than a few days - Rectal bleeding or blood in the stool - Persistent abdominal discomforts, such as cramps, gas, or pain - A feeling that the bowel doesn't empty completely - Weakness or fatigue - Unexplained weight loss  Many people with colorectal cancer experience no symptoms in the early stages of the disease.  2. Natural History:  Colorectal cancer generally begins as a noncancerous growth called a polyp on the inner lining of the colon or rectum. Over time, some of these polyps can become colorectal cancers. The transition from normal tissue to cancer tissue follows a well-defined sequence known as the adenoma-carcinoma sequence.  3. Epidemiology:  Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer diagnosed in both men and women in the United States. The overall lifetime risk of developing colorectal cancer is about 1 in 23 for men and 1 in 25 for women. It is more common in developed countries and the risk increases with age, with more than 90% of cases diagnosed in individuals aged 50 and older.  4. Etiology:  Risk factors for colorectal cancer include:  - Age: The majority of cases are diagnosed in individuals over 50. - Diet: A diet low in fiber and high in fat, calories, red meat, alcohol, and processed meats can increase the risk. - Smoking and heavy alcohol use - Obesity - A personal or family history of colorectal cancer or polyps - Certain inherited syndromes, such as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and Lynch syndrome. - Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) - Type 2 diabetes  5. Pathophysiology:  Most colorectal cancers are adenocarcinomas, which originate from the glandular epithelial cells that line the colon and rectum. Genetic mutations, both inherited and acquired, play a significant role in the development of colorectal cancer. The most common pathway is the adenoma-carcinoma sequence, where a series of mutations in genes such as APC, KRAS, and TP53 leads to the transformation of normal colonic epithelium to adenomatous polyps and ultimately to invasive adenocarcinoma.  6. Differential Diagnosis:  Differential diagnoses include irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), hemorrhoids, anal fissures, and other gastrointestinal malignancies. Infectious colitis, ischemic colitis, and diverticular disease may also present with similar symptoms.  7. Risk factor/predisposing factor   Risk factors include older age, a low-fiber and high-fat diet, a lack of regular physical activity, obesity, alcohol consumption, tobacco use, colorectal polyps, personal and family history of colorectal cancer or colorectal polyps, certain genetic syndromes, and inflammatory bowel disease.  8. Previous Medical History:  A previous history of colorectal cancer or adenomatous polyps increases the risk of developing the disease again. Inflammatory   bowel disease and certain inherited conditions like Lynch syndrome and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) also increase the risk. A family history of colorectal cancer in a first-degree relative can also increase risk.", A 58-year-old man presents with a 3-month history of changes in bowel habits.

Pathophysiology:  Most colorectal cancers are adenocarcinomas, which originate from the glandular epithelial cells that line the colon and rectum. Genetic mutations, both inherited and acquired, play a significant role in the development of colorectal cancer. The most common pathway is the adenoma-carcinoma sequence, where a series of mutations in genes such as APC, KRAS, and TP53 leads to the transformation of normal colonic epithelium to adenomatous polyps and ultimately to invasive adenocarcinoma.  6. Differential Diagnosis:  Differential diagnoses include irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), hemorrhoids, anal fissures, and other gastrointestinal malignancies. Infectious colitis, ischemic colitis, and diverticular disease may also present with similar symptoms.  7. Risk factor/predisposing factor   Risk factors include older age, a low-fiber and high-fat diet, a lack of regular physical activity, obesity, alcohol consumption, tobacco use, colorectal polyps, personal and family history of colorectal cancer or colorectal polyps, certain genetic syndromes, and inflammatory bowel disease.  8. Previous Medical History:  A previous history of colorectal cancer or adenomatous polyps increases the risk of developing the disease again.

Sometimes, however, the right side of the abdomen is more painful, especially in people of Asian descent. - Nausea and vomiting. - Fever. - Abdominal tenderness. - Constipation or, less commonly, diarrhea.  2. Natural History:  Diverticulosis is a condition characterized by the presence of these pouches in the colon. It often presents no symptoms and is usually discovered incidentally.

155,"Diverticulitis  1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:  Diverticulitis occurs when the small pouches, known as diverticula, in the digestive tract become inflamed or infected. Symptoms include:  - Pain that is usually constant and persisting for several days. The lower left side of the abdomen is the usual site of the pain. Sometimes, however, the right side of the abdomen is more painful, especially in people of Asian descent. - Nausea and vomiting. - Fever. - Abdominal tenderness. - Constipation or, less commonly, diarrhea.  2. Natural History:  Diverticulosis is a condition characterized by the presence of these pouches in the colon. It often presents no symptoms and is usually discovered incidentally. When these pouches become inflamed, the condition progresses to diverticulitis. Complications of diverticulitis can include the development of an abscess, perforation of the colon, or an abnormal fistula or passage.  3. Epidemiology:  Diverticulitis is common in Western countries, where it affects up to 50% of those over 60 years of age. It is becoming more common as the population ages. It is less common in Asia and Africa, where the diet tends to be higher in fiber.  4. Etiology:  The exact cause of diverticulitis is unknown, but it is thought that the diverticula become inflamed or infected as a result of stool or bacteria becoming trapped in the pouches. Risk factors include aging, obesity, smoking, lack of exercise, diet high in animal fat and low in fiber, and certain medications including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and steroids.  5. Pathophysiology:  The pathogenesis of diverticulitis is believed to involve erosion of the diverticular wall by increased intraluminal pressure or inspissated fecal material, leading to micro or macro perforation, with resultant pericolic inflammation, abscess formation, or peritonitis.  6. Differential Diagnosis:  Other conditions that can mimic diverticulitis include colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, gastrointestinal infection, and irritable bowel syndrome.

165,"Diverticulosis  1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:  Most people with diverticulosis are asymptomatic. When symptoms do occur, they may include mild cramps, bloating, and constipation. Other conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and stomach ulcers can cause similar problems, so the symptoms could be mistaken for those conditions. If diverticulosis leads to diverticulitis (inflammation or infection of the diverticula), symptoms may include severe abdominal pain, fever, nausea, and a marked change in your bowel habits.  2. Natural History:  Diverticulosis usually develops when naturally weak places in your colon give way under pressure, causing marble-sized pouches (diverticula) to protrude through the colon wall. It is a progressive condition that develops over time, often over many years. As a person ages, the risk of developing diverticulosis increases.  3. Epidemiology:  Diverticulosis is common in Western countries and is typically an age-related condition, with about half of people in the US having diverticulosis by age 60, and nearly everyone having it by age 80. It is interesting to note that it is less common in areas of the world where the diet is high in fiber, such as Asia and Africa.  4. Etiology:  The exact causes of diverticulosis are still unknown, but the condition has several possible risk factors:  - Aging: The risk of diverticulosis increases with age. - Low fiber diet: Diets low in fiber can lead to constipation, which can create a hard stool and increase pressure in the colon, leading to diverticulosis. - Obesity: Being seriously overweight increases your odds of developing diverticulosis. - Smoking: Some studies have found that smoking may increase the risk of developing diverticulosis.  5. Pathophysiology:  Diverticulosis occurs when small, bulging pouches (diverticula) develop in your digestive tract, particularly the colon. When one or more of these pouches become inflamed or infected, the condition is called diverticulitis. The high pressure inside the colon due to muscle straining can push against weak spots in the colon where blood vessels pass through the muscle, forming a pouch or diverticulum.  6. Differential Diagnosis:  Conditions that could present symptoms similar to diverticulosis include irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), gastrointestinal infection, and colon cancer. Thus, these conditions should be ruled out while diagnosing diverticulosis.  7. Risk factor/predisposing factor   A low-fiber diet is a major risk factor for these conditions.

It is a progressive condition that develops over time, often over many years. As a person ages, the risk of developing diverticulosis increases.  3. Epidemiology:  Diverticulosis is common in Western countries and is typically an age-related condition, with about half of people in the US having diverticulosis by age 60, and nearly everyone having it by age 80. It is interesting to note that it is less common in areas of the world where the diet is high in fiber, such as Asia and Africa.  4. Etiology:  The exact causes of diverticulosis are still unknown, but the condition has several possible risk factors:  - Aging: The risk of diverticulosis increases with age. - Low fiber diet: Diets low in fiber can lead to constipation, which can create a hard stool and increase pressure in the colon, leading to diverticulosis. - Obesity: Being seriously overweight increases your odds of developing diverticulosis. - Smoking: Some studies have found that smoking may increase the risk of developing diverticulosis.  5. Pathophysiology:  Diverticulosis occurs when small, bulging pouches (diverticula) develop in your digestive tract, particularly the colon. When one or more of these pouches become inflamed or infected, the condition is called diverticulitis. The high pressure inside the colon due to muscle straining can push against weak spots in the colon where blood vessels pass through the muscle, forming a pouch or diverticulum.  6. Differential Diagnosis:  Conditions that could present symptoms similar to diverticulosis include irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), gastrointestinal infection, and colon cancer. Thus, these conditions should be ruled out while diagnosing diverticulosis.  7. Risk factor/predisposing factor   A low-fiber diet is a major risk factor for these conditions. Other factors include aging, obesity, smoking, lack of exercise, certain medications, and a high-fat diet.  8.

Natural History:  Diverticulosis usually develops when naturally weak places in your colon give way under pressure, causing marble-sized pouches (diverticula) to protrude through the colon wall. It is a progressive condition that develops over time, often over many years. As a person ages, the risk of developing diverticulosis increases.  3. Epidemiology:  Diverticulosis is common in Western countries and is typically an age-related condition, with about half of people in the US having diverticulosis by age 60, and nearly everyone having it by age 80. It is interesting to note that it is less common in areas of the world where the diet is high in fiber, such as Asia and Africa.  4. Etiology:  The exact causes of diverticulosis are still unknown, but the condition has several possible risk factors:  - Aging: The risk of diverticulosis increases with age. - Low fiber diet: Diets low in fiber can lead to constipation, which can create a hard stool and increase pressure in the colon, leading to diverticulosis. - Obesity: Being seriously overweight increases your odds of developing diverticulosis. - Smoking: Some studies have found that smoking may increase the risk of developing diverticulosis.  5. Pathophysiology:  Diverticulosis occurs when small, bulging pouches (diverticula) develop in your digestive tract, particularly the colon. When one or more of these pouches become inflamed or infected, the condition is called diverticulitis. The high pressure inside the colon due to muscle straining can push against weak spots in the colon where blood vessels pass through the muscle, forming a pouch or diverticulum.  6. Differential Diagnosis:  Conditions that could present symptoms similar to diverticulosis include irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), gastrointestinal infection, and colon cancer. Thus, these conditions should be ruled out while diagnosing diverticulosis.  7. Risk factor/predisposing factor   A low-fiber diet is a major risk factor for these conditions. Other factors include aging, obesity, smoking, lack of exercise, certain medications, and a high-fat diet.  8. Previous Medical History:  There are no specific conditions that increase the risk of diverticulosis, but people with a history of low-fiber diets, constipation, or smoking have a higher risk. Also, the risk increases   with age."," A 69-year-old woman visits your clinic complaining of mild lower abdominal cramping and bloating .

Other symptoms can include:  - Severe abdominal pain - Difficulty swallowing or complete inability to swallow - Shortness of breath - Rapid heart rate - Low blood pressure - Fever - Neck pain or swelling  2. Natural History:  Boerhaave syndrome is an acute condition that requires immediate medical attention. If left untreated, it can rapidly progress to shock and death. With prompt diagnosis and treatment, patients can recover, but the condition often leaves significant long-term health impacts due to the potential for additional complications such as abscesses, mediastinitis, and sepsis.  3. Epidemiology:  Boerhaave syndrome is rare, with an estimated incidence of about 3.1 per 1,000,000 people per year. It's more common in males and typically presents in the middle-aged and older population.  4. Etiology:  Boerhaave syndrome is typically caused by a sudden increase in intra-esophageal pressure combined with negative intrathoracic pressure, usually due to forceful or prolonged vomiting. This pressure difference can lead to a spontaneous tear in the esophagus.  5. Pathophysiology:  The increase in intra-esophageal pressure and the sudden decrease in intrathoracic pressure leads to a longitudinal tear, typically in the lower third of the esophagus.

232,"Esophageal Strictures  Esophageal strictures are abnormal narrowings of the esophagus, the tube that carries food and liquids from the mouth to the stomach.   1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:  Symptoms can include difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), food getting stuck in the esophagus, regurgitation of food, chest pain, weight loss, and heartburn.  2. Natural History:  Esophageal strictures typically do not resolve on their own and may worsen over time if untreated. Treatment aims to relieve symptoms and prevent complications such as malnutrition and dehydration from inability to eat and drink properly.  3. Epidemiology:  Esophageal strictures can occur at any age but are more common in adults due to the nature of the causes. There is no significant gender or racial predilection.  4. Etiology:  Esophageal strictures may result from damage to the esophagus that causes inflammation and scarring, which can lead to narrowing. Causes can include gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), swallowing corrosive substances, radiation treatment to the chest or neck, or damage from an endoscope. Rarely, strictures can be congenital (present at birth).  5. Pathophysiology:  The inflammation and scarring that leads to esophageal strictures can result from chronic exposure to stomach acid (as in GERD), irritation from swallowed substances, or damage from medical treatments. This process results in thickening and hardening of the esophageal tissues, reducing the diameter of the esophageal lumen and causing the characteristic narrowing of a stricture.  6. Differential Diagnosis:  Conditions that may present similarly and need to be differentiated from esophageal strictures include:  - Esophageal cancer - Esophageal spasm - Achalasia - Eosinophilic esophagitis  7.

240,"Esophageal Varices  Esophageal varices are abnormally enlarged veins in the esophagus, typically resulting from liver cirrhosis.  1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:  Most individuals with esophageal varices may not present with symptoms until they rupture, which is a medical emergency. When they do rupture, symptoms include:  - Vomiting of blood, often in large amounts - Black, tarry, or bloody stools - Lightheadedness - Loss of consciousness (in severe cases)  2. Natural History:  The progression of esophageal varices is closely related to the severity of liver disease. In individuals with cirrhosis, esophageal varices develop at a rate of about 7% per year. If left untreated, the risk of bleeding is about 30% within two years of diagnosis. Bleeding esophageal varices are a severe complication and are associated with a high mortality rate.  3. Epidemiology:  Esophageal varices are most commonly seen in individuals with liver disease, especially cirrhosis. It is estimated that about 50% of people with cirrhosis develop esophageal varices.  4. Etiology:  The primary cause of esophageal varices is portal hypertension, typically due to liver cirrhosis. Other causes can include blood clots in the portal vein (portal vein thrombosis) or a parasitic infection called schistosomiasis.  5. Pathophysiology:  Esophageal varices form when blood flow to the liver is obstructed by scar tissue in the case of cirrhosis or a blood clot. This causes the blood to flow into smaller vessels that are not designed to carry large volumes of blood. The vessels can leak blood or even rupture, leading to a potentially life-threatening situation.  6.

Natural History:  The progression of esophageal varices is closely related to the severity of liver disease. In individuals with cirrhosis, esophageal varices develop at a rate of about 7% per year. If left untreated, the risk of bleeding is about 30% within two years of diagnosis. Bleeding esophageal varices are a severe complication and are associated with a high mortality rate.  3. Epidemiology:  Esophageal varices are most commonly seen in individuals with liver disease, especially cirrhosis. It is estimated that about 50% of people with cirrhosis develop esophageal varices.  4. Etiology:  The primary cause of esophageal varices is portal hypertension, typically due to liver cirrhosis. Other causes can include blood clots in the portal vein (portal vein thrombosis) or a parasitic infection called schistosomiasis.  5. Pathophysiology:  Esophageal varices form when blood flow to the liver is obstructed by scar tissue in the case of cirrhosis or a blood clot. This causes the blood to flow into smaller vessels that are not designed to carry large volumes of blood. The vessels can leak blood or even rupture, leading to a potentially life-threatening situation.  6. Differential Diagnosis:  Other causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding should be considered, including:  - Gastric varices - Peptic ulcer disease - Gastritis - Esophagitis - Mallory-Weiss tear  7. Risk factor/predisposing factor   These are typically a consequence of liver cirrhosis, as the disease causes high blood pressure in the veins that supply the liver. Alcohol abuse, viral hepatitis, and anything else that can cause liver disease can also contribute to the development of esophageal varices.  8. Any Previous Medical History that is related to the disease:  A history of liver disease, especially cirrhosis, greatly increases the risk of esophageal varices. Other conditions leading to portal hypertension can also be associated. A history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding may be a sign of previously unrecognized esophageal varices.", A 69-year-old man with a known history of cirrhosis due to chronic Hepatitis C infection presents to the hospital.

270,"Food Intolerances (including Lactose Intolerance)  Food intolerances, sometimes referred to as food sensitivities, occur when a person has difficulty digesting a particular type of food, which can lead to symptoms such as intestinal gas, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. Lactose intolerance is a common type of food intolerance.  1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:  Symptoms of food intolerances can vary greatly and may include:  - Nausea - Stomach pain - Gas, cramps, or bloating - Vomiting - Heartburn - Diarrhea - Headaches - Irritability or nervousness  In the case of lactose intolerance, symptoms specifically occur after consuming lactose-containing products and may include bloating, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps.  2. Natural History:  Food intolerances can develop at any stage in life but are often diagnosed in adulthood. They can be long-term conditions, and while they can cause discomfort, they are not life-threatening. Symptoms can often be managed through dietary adjustments.  3. Epidemiology:  Food intolerances are quite common, though their prevalence can vary based on genetic, ethnic, and cultural factors. For example, lactose intolerance is estimated to affect around 65% of the global population, with higher prevalence in people of East Asian, West African, Arab, Jewish, Greek, and Italian descent.  4. Etiology:  Food intolerances can occur due to several reasons including:  - Absence or shortage of certain enzymes needed to digest food. For example, lactose intolerance is caused by a shortage of the enzyme lactase. - Sensitivity to food additives such as sulfites used to preserve dried fruit, canned goods, and wine can cause asthma attacks in sensitive people. - Recurring stress or psychological factors. - Celiac disease, where the immune system reacts to gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye.  5. Pathophysiology:  In food intolerances, the body's inability to digest certain foods or food components leads to their fermentation by gut bacteria, producing gas that results in bloating and discomfort. In lactose intolerance, the lack of sufficient lactase means lactose is not broken down and absorbed in the small intestine and instead, is fermented in the colon.  6. Differential Diagnosis:  Conditions that may need to be differentiated from food intolerances include:  - Food allergies: Unlike intolerances, allergies involve the immune system and can be life-threatening. - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS): This condition can have similar symptoms to food intolerances. - Inflammatory bowel disease - Celiac disease - Gastroenteritis  7.

272,"Food Intolerances (including Lactose Intolerance)  Food intolerances, sometimes referred to as food sensitivities, occur when a person has difficulty digesting a particular type of food, which can lead to symptoms such as intestinal gas, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. Lactose intolerance is a common type of food intolerance.  1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:  Symptoms of food intolerances can vary greatly and may include:  - Nausea - Stomach pain - Gas, cramps, or bloating - Vomiting - Heartburn - Diarrhea - Headaches - Irritability or nervousness  In the case of lactose intolerance, symptoms specifically occur after consuming lactose-containing products and may include bloating, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps.  2. Natural History:  Food intolerances can develop at any stage in life but are often diagnosed in adulthood. They can be long-term conditions, and while they can cause discomfort, they are not life-threatening. Symptoms can often be managed through dietary adjustments.  3. Epidemiology:  Food intolerances are quite common, though their prevalence can vary based on genetic, ethnic, and cultural factors. For example, lactose intolerance is estimated to affect around 65% of the global population, with higher prevalence in people of East Asian, West African, Arab, Jewish, Greek, and Italian descent.  4. Etiology:  Food intolerances can occur due to several reasons including:  - Absence or shortage of certain enzymes needed to digest food. For example, lactose intolerance is caused by a shortage of the enzyme lactase. - Sensitivity to food additives such as sulfites used to preserve dried fruit, canned goods, and wine can cause asthma attacks in sensitive people. - Recurring stress or psychological factors. - Celiac disease, where the immune system reacts to gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye.  5. Pathophysiology:  In food intolerances, the body's inability to digest certain foods or food components leads to their fermentation by gut bacteria, producing gas that results in bloating and discomfort. In lactose intolerance, the lack of sufficient lactase means lactose is not broken down and absorbed in the small intestine and instead, is fermented in the colon.  6. Differential Diagnosis:  Conditions that may need to be differentiated from food intolerances include:  - Food allergies: Unlike intolerances, allergies involve the immune system and can be life-threatening. - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS): This condition can have similar symptoms to food intolerances. - Inflammatory bowel disease - Celiac disease - Gastroenteritis  7.

In lactose intolerance, the lack of sufficient lactase means lactose is not broken down and absorbed in the small intestine and instead, is fermented in the colon.  6. Differential Diagnosis:  Conditions that may need to be differentiated from food intolerances include:  - Food allergies: Unlike intolerances, allergies involve the immune system and can be life-threatening. - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS): This condition can have similar symptoms to food intolerances. - Inflammatory bowel disease - Celiac disease - Gastroenteritis  7. Risk factor/predisposing factor   These are typically genetic. For example, lactose intolerance happens when the body doesn't make enough of an enzyme called lactase, which is needed to digest lactose, the main sugar in milk.  8. Any Previous Medical History that is related to the disease:  A history of gastrointestinal diseases such as IBS, gastroenteritis, or celiac disease can increase the risk of developing food intolerances. In addition, individuals with a family history of food intolerances may be more likely to develop them."," A 27-year-old man presents to the clinic with repeated episodes of abdominal discomfort, bloating, and flatulence.

283,"Food Intolerances (including Lactose Intolerance)  Food intolerances, sometimes referred to as food sensitivities, occur when a person has difficulty digesting a particular type of food, which can lead to symptoms such as intestinal gas, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. Lactose intolerance is a common type of food intolerance.  1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:  Symptoms of food intolerances can vary greatly and may include:  - Nausea - Stomach pain - Gas, cramps, or bloating - Vomiting - Heartburn - Diarrhea - Headaches - Irritability or nervousness  In the case of lactose intolerance, symptoms specifically occur after consuming lactose-containing products and may include bloating, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps.  2. Natural History:  Food intolerances can develop at any stage in life but are often diagnosed in adulthood. They can be long-term conditions, and while they can cause discomfort, they are not life-threatening. Symptoms can often be managed through dietary adjustments.  3. Epidemiology:  Food intolerances are quite common, though their prevalence can vary based on genetic, ethnic, and cultural factors. For example, lactose intolerance is estimated to affect around 65% of the global population, with higher prevalence in people of East Asian, West African, Arab, Jewish, Greek, and Italian descent.  4. Etiology:  Food intolerances can occur due to several reasons including:  - Absence or shortage of certain enzymes needed to digest food. For example, lactose intolerance is caused by a shortage of the enzyme lactase. - Sensitivity to food additives such as sulfites used to preserve dried fruit, canned goods, and wine can cause asthma attacks in sensitive people. - Recurring stress or psychological factors. - Celiac disease, where the immune system reacts to gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye.  5.

294,"Functional Dyspepsia  1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:  Functional dyspepsia, also known as non-ulcer dyspepsia or indigestion, is characterized by chronic or recurrent pain or discomfort centered in the upper abdomen. Unlike IBS, symptoms are not related to the process of defecation. There's no evidence of organic disease or structural abnormality seen on endoscopy. Symptoms of functional dyspepsia can include:  - Feeling full sooner than expected when eating - Discomfort or a burning sensation in the upper abdomen - Bloating in the upper abdomen - Nausea - Belching  2. Natural History:  Functional dyspepsia is a chronic disorder with symptoms that can wax and wane over time. Some patients may experience periods of symptom relief. However, for most patients, dyspepsia is a chronic ailment. A significant proportion of individuals with dyspepsia will have long-term persistence of symptoms.  3. Epidemiology:  Functional dyspepsia is a common disorder with an estimated prevalence of 10-20% in the general population worldwide. It affects both sexes and all ages, although it is more common in women and younger adults.  4. Etiology:  The exact cause of functional dyspepsia is unknown. It's believed that the condition may be related to several factors:  - Abnormal motility in the stomach or small intestine - Sensitivity to acid - Altered perception of gut sensations - Psychosocial factors  5. Pathophysiology:  Functional dyspepsia is thought to arise due to a complex interplay of pathophysiological mechanisms, including impaired gastric accommodation to a meal, delayed gastric emptying, hypersensitivity to gastric distention, and central nervous system dysfunction.  6. Differential Diagnosis:  Other conditions that need to be ruled out when diagnosing functional dyspepsia include:  - Peptic ulcer disease - Gastritis or gastroparesis - Gallstones - Chronic pancreatitis - Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) - Stomach cancer  7.

However, when symptoms do occur, they may include:  - Sudden and rapidly intensifying pain in the upper right portion of the abdomen - Sudden and rapidly intensifying pain in the center of the abdomen, just below the breastbone - Back pain between the shoulder blades - Pain in the right shoulder - Nausea or vomiting  2. Natural History:  Gallstones may remain asymptomatic for years. They are often discovered incidentally during imaging tests for other conditions. When symptoms do develop, it's usually because the gallstone has obstructed the bile duct. This can lead to acute cholecystitis, an inflammation of the gallbladder, which can cause severe pain and fever. If left untreated, gallstones can cause more serious complications, such as gallbladder disease, pancreatitis, and cholangitis.  3. Epidemiology:  Gallstones are a common condition, particularly in the Western world. They affect approximately 10-15% of adults. Women are more likely to develop gallstones than men, and the risk increases with age for both sexes.  4. Etiology:  Gallstones form when there's an imbalance in the substances that make up bile. Factors that contribute to this imbalance include:  - Excess cholesterol: If the bile contains too much cholesterol, it can lead to the formation of cholesterol stones. - Excess bilirubin: Certain conditions, like liver cirrhosis or certain blood disorders, can cause the liver to produce too much bilirubin, leading to pigment stones. - Concentrated bile: If the gallbladder doesn't empty its bile content properly, the bile can become highly concentrated, leading to gallstone formation.  5. Pathophysiology:  Gallstones form in the gallbladder, an organ that stores bile produced by the liver. Bile assists in the digestion of fats. Gallstones can be cholesterol stones (the most common type), pigment stones, or a mix. They range in size from a grain of sand to a golf ball.  6.

Differential Diagnosis:  Gallstone symptoms can mimic those of other conditions, such as:  - Peptic ulcer disease - Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) - Pancreatitis - Gastritis - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) - Heart attack  7. Risk factor/predisposing factor   Risk factors include obesity, pregnancy, a diet high in fat and cholesterol, rapid weight loss, diabetes, and certain genetic factors. It is also more common in females, and the risk increases with age.  8. Previous Medical History:  Several factors can increase the risk of developing gallstones:  - Being female and age: Women, especially those over 40, are more likely to develop gallstones than men. - Obesity: This is a significant risk factor, especially in women. - Pregnancy: Increased estrogen levels during pregnancy can increase cholesterol levels in bile and slow gallbladder movement, leading to gallstones. - Diabetes: People with diabetes tend to have higher levels of triglycerides, which can   contribute to gallstones. - Rapid weight loss: Losing weight too quickly can lead to the formation of gallstones. - Certain medications: Drugs that contain estrogen, such as oral contraceptives or hormone therapy drugs, can increase cholesterol levels in bile and decrease gallbladder movement, both of which can lead to gallstones. - Family history: Gallstones often run in families, suggesting a genetic link.", A 50-year-old woman presents with intense pain in her abdomen that came on suddenly a few hours ago. She also reports back pain between her shoulder blades and nausea. She has a history of obesity and has recently been on a crash diet to lose weight rapidly.

319,"Gallstones  1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:  Many people with gallstones do not have symptoms and are often unaware of their gallstones until they cause complications. However, when symptoms do occur, they may include:  - Sudden and rapidly intensifying pain in the upper right portion of the abdomen - Sudden and rapidly intensifying pain in the center of the abdomen, just below the breastbone - Back pain between the shoulder blades - Pain in the right shoulder - Nausea or vomiting  2. Natural History:  Gallstones may remain asymptomatic for years. They are often discovered incidentally during imaging tests for other conditions. When symptoms do develop, it's usually because the gallstone has obstructed the bile duct. This can lead to acute cholecystitis, an inflammation of the gallbladder, which can cause severe pain and fever. If left untreated, gallstones can cause more serious complications, such as gallbladder disease, pancreatitis, and cholangitis.  3. Epidemiology:  Gallstones are a common condition, particularly in the Western world. They affect approximately 10-15% of adults. Women are more likely to develop gallstones than men, and the risk increases with age for both sexes.  4. Etiology:  Gallstones form when there's an imbalance in the substances that make up bile. Factors that contribute to this imbalance include:  - Excess cholesterol: If the bile contains too much cholesterol, it can lead to the formation of cholesterol stones. - Excess bilirubin: Certain conditions, like liver cirrhosis or certain blood disorders, can cause the liver to produce too much bilirubin, leading to pigment stones. - Concentrated bile: If the gallbladder doesn't empty its bile content properly, the bile can become highly concentrated, leading to gallstone formation.  5.

Factors that contribute to this imbalance include:  - Excess cholesterol: If the bile contains too much cholesterol, it can lead to the formation of cholesterol stones. - Excess bilirubin: Certain conditions, like liver cirrhosis or certain blood disorders, can cause the liver to produce too much bilirubin, leading to pigment stones. - Concentrated bile: If the gallbladder doesn't empty its bile content properly, the bile can become highly concentrated, leading to gallstone formation.  5. Pathophysiology:  Gallstones form in the gallbladder, an organ that stores bile produced by the liver. Bile assists in the digestion of fats. Gallstones can be cholesterol stones (the most common type), pigment stones, or a mix. They range in size from a grain of sand to a golf ball.  6. Differential Diagnosis:  Gallstone symptoms can mimic those of other conditions, such as:  - Peptic ulcer disease - Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) - Pancreatitis - Gastritis - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) - Heart attack  7. Risk factor/predisposing factor   Risk factors include obesity, pregnancy, a diet high in fat and cholesterol, rapid weight loss, diabetes, and certain genetic factors. It is also more common in females, and the risk increases with age.  8. Previous Medical History:  Several factors can increase the risk of developing gallstones:  - Being female and age: Women, especially those over 40, are more likely to develop gallstones than men. - Obesity: This is a significant risk factor, especially in women. - Pregnancy: Increased estrogen levels during pregnancy can increase cholesterol levels in bile and slow gallbladder movement, leading to gallstones. - Diabetes: People with diabetes tend to have higher levels of triglycerides, which can   contribute to gallstones. - Rapid weight loss: Losing weight too quickly can lead to the formation of gallstones. - Certain medications: Drugs that contain estrogen, such as oral contraceptives or hormone therapy drugs, can increase cholesterol levels in bile and decrease gallbladder movement, both of which can lead to gallstones. - Family history: Gallstones often run in families, suggesting a genetic link."," A 52-year-old woman, with a history of obesity and rapid weight loss after undergoing bariatric surgery, presents with severe pain in the upper middle part of her abdomen.

329,"Gallstones  1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:  Many people with gallstones do not have symptoms and are often unaware of their gallstones until they cause complications. However, when symptoms do occur, they may include:  - Sudden and rapidly intensifying pain in the upper right portion of the abdomen - Sudden and rapidly intensifying pain in the center of the abdomen, just below the breastbone - Back pain between the shoulder blades - Pain in the right shoulder - Nausea or vomiting  2. Natural History:  Gallstones may remain asymptomatic for years. They are often discovered incidentally during imaging tests for other conditions. When symptoms do develop, it's usually because the gallstone has obstructed the bile duct. This can lead to acute cholecystitis, an inflammation of the gallbladder, which can cause severe pain and fever. If left untreated, gallstones can cause more serious complications, such as gallbladder disease, pancreatitis, and cholangitis.  3.

Etiology:  Several risk factors contribute to the development of gastric cancer, including:  - Helicobacter pylori infection: This is the most significant risk factor, associated with about 75% of all gastric cancers worldwide. - Diet: Consumption of smoked, pickled, or poorly preserved foods; a diet high in salt; and low intake of fruits and vegetables have been associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer. - Smoking: This doubles the risk of gastric cancer. - Certain health conditions: These include chronic gastritis, pernicious anemia, gastric polyps, and certain inherited conditions such as hereditary diffuse gastric cancer.  5. Pathophysiology:  The pathogenesis of gastric cancer is complex and involves a combination of genetic and environmental factors. It begins with an initial mucosal injury (often due to H. pylori infection), leading to chronic inflammation and a cycle of tissue damage and repair, eventually resulting in changes in the gastric mucosa (atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia), and finally, carcinoma.  6. Differential Diagnosis:  Conditions that may present with similar symptoms include gastric ulcer, gastric lymphoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), chronic gastritis, and non-ulcer dyspepsia.   7.

350,"Gastric Outlet Obstruction (GOO)  Gastric outlet obstruction is a clinical syndrome characterized by epigastric pain and fullness, nausea, vomiting of undigested food, and weight loss due to mechanical obstruction.  1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:  Symptoms include nausea, persistent vomiting (often of undigested food), early satiety (feeling full after eating a small amount of food), weight loss, and dehydration. In severe cases, patients may present with malnutrition or signs of severe dehydration.  2. Natural History:  If untreated, gastric outlet obstruction can lead to severe dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and malnutrition. Symptoms may progressively worsen over time.  3. Epidemiology:  Gastric outlet obstruction can occur at any age but is most common in older adults. The incidence is declining due to decreasing rates of peptic ulcer disease, one of the most common causes of GOO.  4. Etiology:  Causes of gastric outlet obstruction can be benign or malignant. Benign causes include peptic ulcer disease, gastric polyps, or ingestion of caustic substances. Malignant causes include gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, or metastatic cancer to the stomach or nearby organs.  5. Pathophysiology:  Gastric outlet obstruction occurs when there's a blockage in the stomach or the duodenum (the first part of the small intestine) that prevents gastric emptying.

363,"Gastritis  1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:  The symptoms of gastritis vary among individuals, and many people with gastritis have no symptoms. However, common symptoms include:  - Upper abdominal pain or discomfort - Nausea and vomiting - A feeling of fullness in the upper abdomen after eating - Indigestion - Loss of appetite - Hiccups - Bloated feeling or gas - Dark, tar-like stools or the presence of blood in the stool (sign of bleeding in the stomach)  2. Natural History:  Gastritis can be a brief and sudden illness (acute gastritis), a longer-lasting condition (chronic gastritis), or a special condition, perhaps as part of another medical illness (atrophic gastritis, autoimmune gastritis, eosinophilic gastritis). Acute gastritis usually resolves completely with timely treatment. Chronic gastritis may last from weeks to years if not treated.   3. Epidemiology:  Gastritis is a common condition. The prevalence is variable among countries, with a higher prevalence in developing countries, mainly due to H. pylori infection. Acute gastritis is common in people of all ages, while chronic gastritis is more common in older adults.  4. Etiology:  Gastritis can be caused by various factors, including:  - Infection with Helicobacter pylori bacteria - Long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin and ibuprofen - Excessive alcohol consumption - Stress due to severe illness, injury, or surgery - Autoimmune disorders, where the immune system attacks healthy cells in the stomach lining - Other diseases and conditions, like HIV/AIDS, Crohn's disease, and parasitic infections  5. Pathophysiology:  Gastritis is characterized by inflammation and damage to the stomach lining. This can be due to an imbalance between the protective factors (such as mucus and bicarbonate) and the damaging factors (such as acid, pepsin, and H. pylori). In chronic gastritis, continuous inflammation can eventually lead to atrophy of the stomach lining and even gastric cancer.  6. Differential Diagnosis:  Conditions with similar symptoms to gastritis include:  - Peptic ulcer disease - Gallstones or gallbladder disease - Gastroenteritis - Gastric cancer - GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease)  7. Risk factor/predisposing factor   Factors like regular use of certain pain relievers (like NSAIDs), heavy alcohol consumption, stress, and bacterial infection (H.pylori) can lead to gastritis. Additionally, older age and autoimmune disorders are risk factors.  8. Previous Medical History:  A history of H. pylori infection or autoimmune disorders can predispose an individual to gastritis.

Etiology:  Gastritis can be caused by various factors, including:  - Infection with Helicobacter pylori bacteria - Long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin and ibuprofen - Excessive alcohol consumption - Stress due to severe illness, injury, or surgery - Autoimmune disorders, where the immune system attacks healthy cells in the stomach lining - Other diseases and conditions, like HIV/AIDS, Crohn's disease, and parasitic infections  5. Pathophysiology:  Gastritis is characterized by inflammation and damage to the stomach lining. This can be due to an imbalance between the protective factors (such as mucus and bicarbonate) and the damaging factors (such as acid, pepsin, and H. pylori). In chronic gastritis, continuous inflammation can eventually lead to atrophy of the stomach lining and even gastric cancer.  6. Differential Diagnosis:  Conditions with similar symptoms to gastritis include:  - Peptic ulcer disease - Gallstones or gallbladder disease - Gastroenteritis - Gastric cancer - GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease)  7. Risk factor/predisposing factor   Factors like regular use of certain pain relievers (like NSAIDs), heavy alcohol consumption, stress, and bacterial infection (H.pylori) can lead to gastritis. Additionally, older age and autoimmune disorders are risk factors.  8. Previous Medical History:  A history of H. pylori infection or autoimmune disorders can predispose an individual to gastritis. Other factors that can increase the risk include chronic vomiting, excessive alcohol consumption, and the use of NSAIDs or other drugs that can irritate the stomach lining."," A 55-year-old woman presents to the clinic with complaints of recurrent episodes of upper abdominal pain and a sensation of bloating for the past few months.

375,"Gastroenteritis (Various causes - viral, bacterial)  1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:  Gastroenteritis, also known as infectious diarrhea, is characterized by the inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, including both the stomach and the small intestine. Symptoms may include:  - Diarrhea - Nausea and vomiting - Abdominal pain and cramping - Fever - Loss of appetite - Dehydration symptoms such as dry mouth, feeling thirsty, decreased urine output, dark yellow urine, and feeling dizzy or light-headed.  2. Natural History:  Gastroenteritis is typically an acute illness that tends to resolve on its own within a few days to a week, depending on the causative organism. However, in some cases, particularly in immunocompromised individuals, the elderly, and young children, it can cause severe dehydration and require hospitalization.  3. Epidemiology:  Gastroenteritis affects people worldwide, with viral causes being the most common. It's one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among young children globally, particularly in developing countries where access to clean water and sanitation is limited. It's also common in developed countries, often spreading in closed environments such as schools, childcare centers, and nursing homes.  4. Etiology:  Gastroenteritis can be caused by a variety of organisms, including viruses, bacteria, and parasites. The most common causes include:  - Viruses: Norovirus and rotavirus are the most common viral causes. Other viruses include adenovirus and astrovirus. - Bacteria: Common bacterial causes include Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella, and Escherichia coli (E. coli). Bacterial gastroenteritis can also be caused by Clostridium difficile, particularly in individuals who have been using antibiotics.  5. Pathophysiology:  In gastroenteritis, the offending organism enters the body, typically through the oral route, and causes inflammation and damage to the lining of the stomach and intestines. This results in increased secretion and reduced absorption of fluids and electrolytes, leading to watery diarrhea. Vomiting may occur due to inflammation and irritation of the stomach lining.  6. Differential Diagnosis:  Conditions that may present with similar symptoms include food poisoning, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, celiac disease, lactose intolerance, and appendicitis. It's important to differentiate these conditions from gastroenteritis during diagnosis.  7. Risk factor/predisposing factor   This is usually caused by viral or bacterial infection. Risk factors include poor sanitation, close contact with someone who has the virus, a weakened immune system, and consuming contaminated food or water.  8. Previous Medical History:  Individuals with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS, cancer, or those on immunosuppressive medications, are at higher risk of gastroenteritis and may experience more severe disease. Those with previous gastrointestinal surgery or chronic gastrointestinal diseases may also be at increased risk.

390,"Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)  1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:  The symptoms of GERD can range from mild to severe and may occur at any time of the day. Some common symptoms include:  - Heartburn: This is the most common symptom, characterized by a burning sensation in the chest, usually after eating, which might be worse at night. - Regurgitation: This is the sensation of acid backing up into your throat or mouth, producing a sour or bitter taste. - Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) - Chronic cough or asthma - Chest pain - Feeling like there's a lump in your throat - Hoarseness, especially in the morning - Disturbed sleep  2. Natural History:  GERD is a chronic condition. Once it begins, it usually is life-long. If there is injury to the lining of the esophagus (esophagitis), this also is a chronic condition. Moreover, after the esophagus has healed with treatment and treatment is stopped, the injury will return in most patients within a few months. Once treatment for GERD is begun, therefore, it usually will need to be continued indefinitely.  3. Epidemiology:  GERD is a prevalent condition worldwide, and it is estimated to affect about 20% of the Western population. It can occur in people of all ages, but it is more common in adults over 40.  4. Etiology:  The main cause of GERD is a problem with the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) ??a circular band of muscle at the bottom of the esophagus that acts like a gate to the stomach. In GERD, this gate opens spontaneously for varying periods of time or does not close properly and stomach contents rise up into the esophagus. Other contributing factors include hiatal hernias, obesity, pregnancy, certain medications, and smoking.  5. Pathophysiology:  GERD occurs when the LES is weak or relaxes inappropriately, allowing the stomach's contents to flow up into the esophagus. The stomach produces hydrochloric acid after a meal to aid the digestion of food. The inner lining of the stomach resists corrosion by this acid because cells that line the stomach secrete large amounts of protective mucus. The lining of the esophagus does not share these resistant features and stomach acid can damage it.  6. Differential Diagnosis:  GERD's symptoms overlap with many other conditions. The differential diagnosis includes:  - Peptic ulcer disease - Angina pectoris or myocardial infarction - Gallbladder disease - Eosinophilic esophagitis - Functional dyspepsia - Gastroparesis - Achalasia  7. Risk factor/predisposing factor  Lifestyle and predisposing factors for GERD include obesity, smoking, pregnancy, certain medications, and consuming certain types of food and drinks such as high fat foods, alcohol, caffeine, chocolate, and citrus fruits. Lying down or going to bed shortly after eating, particularly after having a large meal, can also contribute to GERD.   8. Previous Medical History:  A history of certain conditions can predispose an individual to GERD:  - Hiatal hernia - Asthma - Diabetes - Connective tissue disorders, such as scleroderma - Zollinger-Ellison syndrome - Delayed stomach emptying  Moreover, certain habits or medications can exacerbate GERD, including smoking, alcohol use, and medications like NSAIDs, certain muscle relaxants, and blood pressure medications."," A 57-year-old woman presents to your clinic with a 3-month history of a burning sensation in her chest.

396,"Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)  1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:  The symptoms of GERD can range from mild to severe and may occur at any time of the day. Some common symptoms include:  - Heartburn: This is the most common symptom, characterized by a burning sensation in the chest, usually after eating, which might be worse at night. - Regurgitation: This is the sensation of acid backing up into your throat or mouth, producing a sour or bitter taste. - Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) - Chronic cough or asthma - Chest pain - Feeling like there's a lump in your throat - Hoarseness, especially in the morning - Disturbed sleep  2. Natural History:  GERD is a chronic condition. Once it begins, it usually is life-long. If there is injury to the lining of the esophagus (esophagitis), this also is a chronic condition. Moreover, after the esophagus has healed with treatment and treatment is stopped, the injury will return in most patients within a few months. Once treatment for GERD is begun, therefore, it usually will need to be continued indefinitely.  3. Epidemiology:  GERD is a prevalent condition worldwide, and it is estimated to affect about 20% of the Western population. It can occur in people of all ages, but it is more common in adults over 40.  4. Etiology:  The main cause of GERD is a problem with the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) ??a circular band of muscle at the bottom of the esophagus that acts like a gate to the stomach. In GERD, this gate opens spontaneously for varying periods of time or does not close properly and stomach contents rise up into the esophagus. Other contributing factors include hiatal hernias, obesity, pregnancy, certain medications, and smoking.  5. Pathophysiology:  GERD occurs when the LES is weak or relaxes inappropriately, allowing the stomach's contents to flow up into the esophagus. The stomach produces hydrochloric acid after a meal to aid the digestion of food. The inner lining of the stomach resists corrosion by this acid because cells that line the stomach secrete large amounts of protective mucus. The lining of the esophagus does not share these resistant features and stomach acid can damage it.  6. Differential Diagnosis:  GERD's symptoms overlap with many other conditions.

The prevalence is likely underestimated due to misdiagnosis and the overlap of symptoms with other gastrointestinal disorders.  4. Etiology:  The most common known cause of gastroparesis is diabetes, which can damage the vagus nerve that controls the stomach muscles. Other causes include surgery on the stomach or vagus nerve and certain medications like opioids and some antidepressants. However, in many cases, the cause is unknown (idiopathic gastroparesis).  5. Pathophysiology:  In gastroparesis, the motility of the stomach is impaired, either due to a problem with the stomach muscles, the nerves controlling these muscles, or both. This results in delayed emptying of the stomach's contents into the small intestine.  6. Differential Diagnosis:  Gastroparesis symptoms can mimic other conditions, including: - Peptic ulcer disease - Gastric outlet obstruction - Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)  7.

Other factors can include certain medications, abdominal or esophageal surgery, infection, hypothyroidism, nervous system diseases like Parkinson's or multiple sclerosis, and certain psychological conditions.  8. Any Previous Medical History that is related to the disease:  A history of diabetes, abdominal or vagus nerve surgery, or certain neurological conditions like Parkinson's disease can increase the risk of developing gastroparesis.

431,"Hemorrhoids  1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:  Hemorrhoids can be internal (inside the rectum) or external (under the skin around the anus), and the symptoms vary accordingly. Common symptoms include:  - Painless bleeding during bowel movements, which might manifest as bright red blood on toilet paper or in the toilet bowl - Itching or irritation in the anal region - Pain or discomfort - Swelling around the anus - A lump near the anus, which may be sensitive or painful (may be a thrombosed hemorrhoid) - Leakage of feces  2. Natural History:  Hemorrhoids are chronic and tend to flare up periodically and then diminish. Over time, the symptoms can worsen due to further stretching and sagging of the supportive tissue in the rectum and anus. While hemorrhoids can cause discomfort and bleeding, they do not threaten one's health and can typically be managed with lifestyle modifications and non-surgical treatments. In severe cases, surgical intervention may be necessary.  3. Epidemiology:  Hemorrhoids are a common condition, affecting both men and women. They can occur at any age but are more common in adults aged 45 to 65. Pregnant women are also at an increased risk.  4. Etiology:  Factors that can increase the pressure in the lower rectum and lead to hemorrhoids include:  - Straining during bowel movements - Sitting for long periods, especially on the toilet - Chronic constipation or diarrhea - Obesity - Pregnancy - Low-fiber diet - Anal intercourse - Aging, as the tissues can weaken and stretch  5.

Differential Diagnosis:  Conditions that can present with similar symptoms include other forms of hepatitis (D, E), alcoholic hepatitis, drug-induced liver injury, autoimmune hepatitis, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. These conditions should be ruled out during diagnosis.  7. Risk factor/predisposing factor   Hepatitis A is primarily spread through contaminated food or water. Hepatitis B and C are primarily spread through blood and body fluids. High-risk behaviors include unsafe sex, intravenous drug use, and sharing personal items like razors or toothbrushes. Certain occupations, international travel, and alcoholism are other potential risk factors.  8. Previous Medical History:  People with a history of intravenous drug use, unprotected sex, or blood transfusions are at higher risk for hepatitis B and C. Individuals with a history of travel to areas with high hepatitis A prevalence, or those who work in   healthcare or childcare, may be at increased risk for hepatitis A.

450,"Hiatal Hernia  A hiatal hernia occurs when part of your stomach pushes upward through your diaphragm, which is a large muscle separating your abdomen and chest.  1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:  A small hiatal hernia often doesn't cause problems, and you may never know you have a hiatal hernia unless your doctor discovers it when checking for another condition. But a large hiatal hernia can allow food and acid to back up into your esophagus, leading to heartburn, chest pain, belching, and nausea.  2. Natural History:  A hiatal hernia can be a congenital condition present from birth, or it can develop over many years later in life. Hiatal hernias do not resolve by themselves and tend to gradually increase in size over time. The progression of symptoms may be slow, and the severity of symptoms often correlates with the size of the hernia.  3. Epidemiology:  Hiatal hernias are most common in people who are 50 or older and obese. The exact prevalence is not known as many people with hiatal hernia are asymptomatic. Some estimates suggest that up to 60% of people aged 50 or older may have a hiatal hernia.  4. Etiology:  The exact cause of many hiatal hernias isn't known. In some people, injury or other damage may weaken muscle tissue. This makes it possible for your stomach to push through your diaphragm. Other causes include consistent pressure on surrounding muscles, such as coughing, vomiting, straining during a bowel movement, exercise, or lifting heavy objects.  5. Pathophysiology:  The diaphragm has a small opening (hiatus) through which the food tube (esophagus) passes before connecting to the stomach. In a hiatal hernia, the stomach bulges up into the chest through that opening. The cause of hiatal hernias is not entirely understood, but a weakening of the diaphragm with age or pressure on the abdomen could play a role.  6. Differential Diagnosis:  Conditions that may present similarly and need to be differentiated from a hiatal hernia include:  - Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) - Peptic ulcer disease - Angina or myocardial infarction - Gallbladder disease  7. Risk factor/predisposing factor   Risk factors include age over 50, obesity, and smoking. In some cases, increased pressure in the abdomen from coughing, straining during bowel movements, pregnancy and delivery, or substantial weight gain may contribute.  8.

452,"Hiatal Hernia  A hiatal hernia occurs when part of your stomach pushes upward through your diaphragm, which is a large muscle separating your abdomen and chest.  1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:  A small hiatal hernia often doesn't cause problems, and you may never know you have a hiatal hernia unless your doctor discovers it when checking for another condition. But a large hiatal hernia can allow food and acid to back up into your esophagus, leading to heartburn, chest pain, belching, and nausea.  2. Natural History:  A hiatal hernia can be a congenital condition present from birth, or it can develop over many years later in life. Hiatal hernias do not resolve by themselves and tend to gradually increase in size over time. The progression of symptoms may be slow, and the severity of symptoms often correlates with the size of the hernia.  3. Epidemiology:  Hiatal hernias are most common in people who are 50 or older and obese. The exact prevalence is not known as many people with hiatal hernia are asymptomatic. Some estimates suggest that up to 60% of people aged 50 or older may have a hiatal hernia.  4. Etiology:  The exact cause of many hiatal hernias isn't known. In some people, injury or other damage may weaken muscle tissue. This makes it possible for your stomach to push through your diaphragm. Other causes include consistent pressure on surrounding muscles, such as coughing, vomiting, straining during a bowel movement, exercise, or lifting heavy objects.  5. Pathophysiology:  The diaphragm has a small opening (hiatus) through which the food tube (esophagus) passes before connecting to the stomach. In a hiatal hernia, the stomach bulges up into the chest through that opening. The cause of hiatal hernias is not entirely understood, but a weakening of the diaphragm with age or pressure on the abdomen could play a role.  6. Differential Diagnosis:  Conditions that may present similarly and need to be differentiated from a hiatal hernia include:  - Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) - Peptic ulcer disease - Angina or myocardial infarction - Gallbladder disease  7. Risk factor/predisposing factor   Risk factors include age over 50, obesity, and smoking. In some cases, increased pressure in the abdomen from coughing, straining during bowel movements, pregnancy and delivery, or substantial weight gain may contribute.  8. Any Previous Medical History that is related to the disease:  Those with a history of conditions that increase the pressure in the abdomen, such as obesity, pregnancy, and constipation, may have an increased risk of developing a hiatal hernia. Prior surgeries or injuries to the diaphragm area can also increase the risk."," A 55-year-old man with a history of asthma presents with discomfort in his chest, feeling like he has food stuck in his chest after eating.

Epidemiology:  Hiatal hernias are most common in people who are 50 or older and obese. The exact prevalence is not known as many people with hiatal hernia are asymptomatic. Some estimates suggest that up to 60% of people aged 50 or older may have a hiatal hernia.  4. Etiology:  The exact cause of many hiatal hernias isn't known. In some people, injury or other damage may weaken muscle tissue. This makes it possible for your stomach to push through your diaphragm. Other causes include consistent pressure on surrounding muscles, such as coughing, vomiting, straining during a bowel movement, exercise, or lifting heavy objects.  5. Pathophysiology:  The diaphragm has a small opening (hiatus) through which the food tube (esophagus) passes before connecting to the stomach. In a hiatal hernia, the stomach bulges up into the chest through that opening. The cause of hiatal hernias is not entirely understood, but a weakening of the diaphragm with age or pressure on the abdomen could play a role.  6. Differential Diagnosis:  Conditions that may present similarly and need to be differentiated from a hiatal hernia include:  - Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) - Peptic ulcer disease - Angina or myocardial infarction - Gallbladder disease  7. Risk factor/predisposing factor   Risk factors include age over 50, obesity, and smoking. In some cases, increased pressure in the abdomen from coughing, straining during bowel movements, pregnancy and delivery, or substantial weight gain may contribute.  8. Any Previous Medical History that is related to the disease:  Those with a history of conditions that increase the pressure in the abdomen, such as obesity, pregnancy, and constipation, may have an increased risk of developing a hiatal hernia. Prior surgeries or injuries to the diaphragm area can also increase the risk."," A 52-year-old woman presents to the clinic with complaints of difficulty swallowing and a feeling of food getting stuck in her chest after eating.

464,"Hiatal Hernia  A hiatal hernia occurs when part of your stomach pushes upward through your diaphragm, which is a large muscle separating your abdomen and chest.  1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:  A small hiatal hernia often doesn't cause problems, and you may never know you have a hiatal hernia unless your doctor discovers it when checking for another condition. But a large hiatal hernia can allow food and acid to back up into your esophagus, leading to heartburn, chest pain, belching, and nausea.  2. Natural History:  A hiatal hernia can be a congenital condition present from birth, or it can develop over many years later in life. Hiatal hernias do not resolve by themselves and tend to gradually increase in size over time. The progression of symptoms may be slow, and the severity of symptoms often correlates with the size of the hernia.  3.

465,"Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)  Inflammatory Bowel Disease, including Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis, is a chronic inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract.  1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:  Common symptoms of both Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis include:  - Diarrhea - Abdominal pain and cramping - Blood in stool - Fatigue and reduced appetite - Unintended weight loss  Crohn's Disease can affect any part of the GI tract from mouth to anus, while Ulcerative Colitis only affects the colon and rectum.  2. Natural History:  Both Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis are lifelong diseases that usually begin in early adulthood. They typically have a relapsing-remitting course, with periods of remission interspersed with episodes of active disease.  3. Epidemiology:  IBD affects millions of people worldwide, with the highest prevalence in North America and Europe. It affects males and females equally.  4. Etiology:  The exact cause of IBD is unknown, but it's likely due to an interaction between genetics, the immune system, and environmental factors. The immune system is thought to react abnormally to the gut microbiota in genetically susceptible individuals, leading to chronic inflammation.  5. Pathophysiology:  In IBD, there's an inappropriate and ongoing activation of the immune system in the gastrointestinal tract. In response to an unknown trigger, the immune system begins to produce inflammation in the GI tract wall, leading to the symptoms of IBD.  6. Differential Diagnosis:  IBD symptoms can mimic other GI conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), celiac disease, and infectious gastroenteritis.

Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:  Symptoms of an intestinal obstruction can include:  - Crampy abdominal pain that comes and goes - Loss of appetite - Constipation - Vomiting - Inability to have a bowel movement or pass gas - Swelling of the abdomen  2. Natural History:  Intestinal obstructions can be acute or chronic. Acute obstructions occur suddenly and require immediate medical attention. Chronic obstructions develop over a longer period and symptoms may come and go. If left untreated, an obstruction can lead to severe, life-threatening complications, including tissue death and sepsis.  3. Epidemiology:  Intestinal obstructions are a common surgical emergency. It is estimated that about 20% of hospital admissions for acute abdominal pain in the United States are due to small bowel obstruction. The condition can occur in individuals of any age but is most common in the elderly population.  4. Etiology:  Intestinal obstructions are most commonly caused by adhesions (scar tissue) from previous abdominal surgery.

Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:  Symptoms of an intestinal obstruction can include:  - Crampy abdominal pain that comes and goes - Loss of appetite - Constipation - Vomiting - Inability to have a bowel movement or pass gas - Swelling of the abdomen  2. Natural History:  Intestinal obstructions can be acute or chronic. Acute obstructions occur suddenly and require immediate medical attention. Chronic obstructions develop over a longer period and symptoms may come and go. If left untreated, an obstruction can lead to severe, life-threatening complications, including tissue death and sepsis.  3. Epidemiology:  Intestinal obstructions are a common surgical emergency. It is estimated that about 20% of hospital admissions for acute abdominal pain in the United States are due to small bowel obstruction.

Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:  The symptoms of IBS vary but can include:  - Abdominal pain or cramping that is often relieved by passing a bowel movement - Changes in bowel habits ??such as diarrhea, constipation, or both alternately, often with a sense of incomplete bowel movement - Excess gas - Mucus in the stool - Bloating - Food intolerance  Some people may also have sexual problems and urinary symptoms, such as frequency, urgency, and discomfort.  2. Natural History:  IBS is a chronic condition that needs long-term management. The course of IBS is highly variable, and it often includes periods of increased symptoms, or flare-ups, and periods of remission. The symptoms might change over time. While IBS can cause significant discomfort, it does not lead to serious complications, like cancer.  3. Epidemiology:  IBS is a common disorder, affecting 10-15% of the population worldwide. It is more common in women than in men and often begins in early adulthood.  4. Etiology:  The exact cause of IBS isn't known. It's believed to be due to a combination of factors, including:  - Abnormal gastrointestinal (GI) motility: This can cause the bowel to contract too much or not enough. - Visceral hypersensitivity: People with IBS often have an increased sensitivity to abdominal pain. - Post-infectious IBS: IBS can develop after a severe bout of diarrhea (gastroenteritis) caused by bacteria or a virus. - Changes in gut microbiota: These are the 'good' bacteria in the gut. - Brain-gut interactions: Psychological stress can affect functioning of the GI tract. - Genetic factors: IBS can run in families.  5. Pathophysiology:  The pathophysiology of IBS is complex and not fully understood. It is thought to involve multiple factors, including abnormal GI motility, visceral hypersensitivity, inflammation, bacterial overgrowth, alterations in gut microbiota, and dysfunction in the brain-gut axis. These factors can lead to changes in how the brain and gut interact, resulting in the symptoms of IBS.  6. Differential Diagnosis:  The differential diagnosis for IBS includes conditions that present with similar symptoms, such as:  - Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) - Celiac disease - Food intolerances or allergies - Gastroenteritis - Diverticulitis - Colorectal cancer  7. Risk factor/predisposing factor   Stress and certain foods (like those high in FODMAPs - Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides, and Polyols) can trigger IBS symptoms. A sedentary lifestyle, certain medications, and irregular eating habits may also contribute. There seems to be a hereditary component as well, indicating a possible genetic predisposition.  8. Previous Medical History:  Previous GI infections can increase the risk of developing IBS. A history of physical or sexual abuse or other traumatic experiences can also increase susceptibility to IBS, as can a family history of the disorder."," A 45-year-old man presents to the clinic with complaints of chronic, episodic abdominal pain, bloating, and noticeable changes in bowel habits for the past three months.

510,"Ischemic Colitis  1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:  Ischemic colitis typically presents with sudden onset abdominal pain and tenderness, often on the left side. It is frequently accompanied by an urgent need to defecate, and passage of bright red blood or bloody diarrhea.   2. Natural History:  Most cases of ischemic colitis are transient and resolve within 1-2 weeks. However, some patients may experience chronic ischemic colitis, which can lead to long-term changes in bowel habits, recurrent bloody stools, and weight loss. Severe cases can result in bowel necrosis and require surgical intervention.  3. Epidemiology:  Ischemic colitis is the most common form of intestinal ischemia, accounting for over 50% of cases. It's more common in older adults (60 years and above), but it can occur at any age. The incidence is slightly higher in females.  4. Etiology:  Ischemic colitis is usually caused by a temporary or permanent reduction in blood flow (ischemia) to the colon, often due to blocked or narrowed blood vessels. Conditions that can cause this include atherosclerosis, low blood pressure/shock, and certain diseases such as diabetes and lupus. Certain medications, like diuretics, heart medications, and migraine treatments, can also contribute to the development of ischemic colitis.  5. Pathophysiology:  Ischemic colitis occurs when blood flow to the colon is reduced, usually due to occlusion or narrowing of the arteries that supply it. This reduction in blood flow can lead to inflammation and injury to the colon. If the blood flow is not restored, it can cause the affected part of the colon to die (necrosis).  6. Differential Diagnosis:  The differential diagnosis for ischemic colitis includes other causes of abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, such as inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis), infectious colitis, diverticulitis, and colorectal cancer.  7. Risk factor/predisposing factor   This condition is often associated with atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), heart disease or arrhythmias, low blood pressure, certain types of surgery, certain medications, and dehydration.  8. Any Previous Medical History that is related to the disease:  Previous history of cardiovascular disease, particularly atherosclerosis, can increase the risk for ischemic colitis.

Conditions that increase blood clotting (like certain heart rhythms, clotting disorders, or recent surgeries) also increase risk."," A 70-year-old man with a past medical history significant for hypertension, diabetes, and high cholesterol presents to the emergency department with sudden onset left-sided abdominal pain and an urgent need to defecate.

Conditions that can cause this include atherosclerosis, low blood pressure/shock, and certain diseases such as diabetes and lupus. Certain medications, like diuretics, heart medications, and migraine treatments, can also contribute to the development of ischemic colitis.  5. Pathophysiology:  Ischemic colitis occurs when blood flow to the colon is reduced, usually due to occlusion or narrowing of the arteries that supply it. This reduction in blood flow can lead to inflammation and injury to the colon. If the blood flow is not restored, it can cause the affected part of the colon to die (necrosis).  6. Differential Diagnosis:  The differential diagnosis for ischemic colitis includes other causes of abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, such as inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis), infectious colitis, diverticulitis, and colorectal cancer.  7. Risk factor/predisposing factor   This condition is often associated with atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), heart disease or arrhythmias, low blood pressure, certain types of surgery, certain medications, and dehydration.  8. Any Previous Medical History that is related to the disease:  Previous history of cardiovascular disease, particularly atherosclerosis, can increase the risk for ischemic colitis. Other risk factors include age over 60, diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, renal failure, and certain medications such as diuretics and those that can cause constipation. Conditions that increase blood clotting (like certain heart rhythms, clotting disorders, or recent surgeries) also increase risk."," A 68-year-old woman with a history of congestive heart failure presents to the clinic with recurrent episodes of abdominal pain and bloody stools over the past month.

524,"Ischemic Colitis  1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:  Ischemic colitis typically presents with sudden onset abdominal pain and tenderness, often on the left side. It is frequently accompanied by an urgent need to defecate, and passage of bright red blood or bloody diarrhea.   2. Natural History:  Most cases of ischemic colitis are transient and resolve within 1-2 weeks. However, some patients may experience chronic ischemic colitis, which can lead to long-term changes in bowel habits, recurrent bloody stools, and weight loss. Severe cases can result in bowel necrosis and require surgical intervention.  3. Epidemiology:  Ischemic colitis is the most common form of intestinal ischemia, accounting for over 50% of cases. It's more common in older adults (60 years and above), but it can occur at any age. The incidence is slightly higher in females.  4. Etiology:  Ischemic colitis is usually caused by a temporary or permanent reduction in blood flow (ischemia) to the colon, often due to blocked or narrowed blood vessels. Conditions that can cause this include atherosclerosis, low blood pressure/shock, and certain diseases such as diabetes and lupus. Certain medications, like diuretics, heart medications, and migraine treatments, can also contribute to the development of ischemic colitis.  5. Pathophysiology:  Ischemic colitis occurs when blood flow to the colon is reduced, usually due to occlusion or narrowing of the arteries that supply it. This reduction in blood flow can lead to inflammation and injury to the colon. If the blood flow is not restored, it can cause the affected part of the colon to die (necrosis).  6. Differential Diagnosis:  The differential diagnosis for ischemic colitis includes other causes of abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, such as inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis), infectious colitis, diverticulitis, and colorectal cancer.  7. Risk factor/predisposing factor   This condition is often associated with atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), heart disease or arrhythmias, low blood pressure, certain types of surgery, certain medications, and dehydration.  8.

525,"Liver Cancer  Liver cancer is a type of malignancy that originates in the cells of the liver. The most common type of liver cancer is hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).  1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:  Symptoms may not appear in the early stages of liver cancer, but as the disease progresses, symptoms may include:  - Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes) - Abdominal pain, particularly in the upper right part of the abdomen - Swelling in the abdomen - Unexplained weight loss - Loss of appetite and feeling full after a small meal - Nausea and vomiting - General fatigue - White, chalky stools  2. Natural History:  Liver cancer usually develops over years and is typically preceded by cirrhosis, a scarring of the liver, or chronic hepatitis infections. Once developed, it often progresses quickly, leading to liver failure, unless detected early and treated.  3. Epidemiology:  Liver cancer is the sixth most commonly diagnosed cancer and the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide. It is more common in low- and middle-income countries than in high-income countries. It is more common in males than females.  4.

Pathophysiology:  Cirrhosis occurs in response to damage to your liver. Each time your liver is injured, it tries to repair itself. In the process, scar tissue forms. As the cirrhosis progresses, more and more scar tissue forms, making it difficult for the liver to function.  6. Differential Diagnosis:  Conditions that can mimic the presentation of cirrhosis include right heart failure, fulminant liver failure, and other causes of chronic liver disease. Hepatitis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease may also present with similar symptoms.  7. Risk factor/predisposing factor   The most common causes are heavy alcohol use, chronic viral hepatitis (B and C), and fatty liver disease associated with obesity and diabetes. Other potential risk factors include certain genetic diseases, a buildup of iron or copper in the body, cystic fibrosis, autoimmune disease, and destruction of the bile ducts.  8. Previous Medical History:  A history of chronic liver disease, such as chronic viral hepatitis or alcoholic liver disease, can lead to cirrhosis.

573,"Mesenteric Ischemia  1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:  Acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) presents with sudden severe abdominal pain out of proportion to physical findings, often associated with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) usually presents with postprandial abdominal pain (intestinal angina), leading to food aversion and significant weight loss.  2. Natural History:  Without treatment, AMI can progress to bowel infarction, sepsis, and death. CMI, while typically not life-threatening, can significantly affect quality of life and may progress to AMI.  3. Epidemiology:  AMI accounts for about 0.1% of all hospital admissions but its mortality rate remains high (60-80%). CMI is less common, mostly affecting people over 60. It is more common in women and those with cardiovascular risk factors.  4. Etiology:  Mesenteric ischemia can be due to decreased blood flow caused by blockage (such as a blood clot) or narrowing (stenosis) in one or more of the mesenteric arteries or veins. It can be acute or chronic. The most common cause of AMI is embolic occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery. CMI usually results from atherosclerosis.  5.

585,"Pancreatic Cancer  1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:  Pancreatic cancer often doesn't show symptoms in the early stages. Symptoms that may occur as the disease progresses include: - Unintentional weight loss - Loss of appetite - Abdominal pain that radiates to the back - Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes) - Dark urine - Light-colored or greasy stools - Itchy skin - New-onset diabetes - Blood clots  2. Natural History:  Pancreatic cancer is typically aggressive, with few symptoms until the cancer has advanced and prognosis is poor. Without treatment, patients may only live a few months after diagnosis. Even with treatment, the overall 5-year survival rate is low.  3. Epidemiology:  Pancreatic cancer represents about 3% of all cancers in the United States and about 7% of all cancer deaths. The average age at the time of diagnosis is 70. Men are slightly more likely to develop pancreatic cancer than women.  4. Etiology:  The exact cause of pancreatic cancer is unknown. However, certain risk factors are associated with the disease, including smoking, obesity, age, family history of pancreatic cancer or pancreatitis, and certain inherited gene mutations.  5. Pathophysiology:  Pancreatic cancer begins when abnormal cells within the pancreas grow out of control. These cells continue living when normal cells would die, accumulating to form a tumor. Most pancreatic cancers are exocrine cancers (pancreatic adenocarcinomas). Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), which are less common, often have a better prognosis.  6.

598,"Pancreatic Cancer  1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:  Pancreatic cancer often doesn't show symptoms in the early stages. Symptoms that may occur as the disease progresses include: - Unintentional weight loss - Loss of appetite - Abdominal pain that radiates to the back - Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes) - Dark urine - Light-colored or greasy stools - Itchy skin - New-onset diabetes - Blood clots  2. Natural History:  Pancreatic cancer is typically aggressive, with few symptoms until the cancer has advanced and prognosis is poor. Without treatment, patients may only live a few months after diagnosis. Even with treatment, the overall 5-year survival rate is low.  3. Epidemiology:  Pancreatic cancer represents about 3% of all cancers in the United States and about 7% of all cancer deaths. The average age at the time of diagnosis is 70. Men are slightly more likely to develop pancreatic cancer than women.  4. Etiology:  The exact cause of pancreatic cancer is unknown. However, certain risk factors are associated with the disease, including smoking, obesity, age, family history of pancreatic cancer or pancreatitis, and certain inherited gene mutations.  5. Pathophysiology:  Pancreatic cancer begins when abnormal cells within the pancreas grow out of control. These cells continue living when normal cells would die, accumulating to form a tumor. Most pancreatic cancers are exocrine cancers (pancreatic adenocarcinomas). Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), which are less common, often have a better prognosis.  6. Differential Diagnosis:  Differential diagnosis for pancreatic cancer can include chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic cysts, pancreatic pseudocyst, and other intra-abdominal malignancies.  7. Risk factor/predisposing factor   Risk factors include tobacco smoking, obesity, diabetes, and certain types of inherited genetic syndromes. Chronic pancreatitis and a family history of pancreatic cancer can also increase risk.  8. Any Previous Medical History that is related to the disease:  Certain genetic syndromes, including BRCA2 gene mutation, Lynch syndrome, and familial atypical mole-malignant melanoma (FAMMM) syndrome, can increase the risk of pancreatic cancer. Chronic pancreatitis and diabetes may also increase risk. A family history of pancreatic cancer, especially in a parent, sibling, or child, can double the risk of developing this disease."," A 68-year-old man presents to the clinic with complaints of persistent fatigue, loss of appetite, and unexplained weight loss.

Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:  The most common symptom of peptic ulcers is abdominal pain, typically described as a burning sensation, that is often felt anywhere from the navel up to the sternum. Other symptoms may include:  - Changes in appetite, often accompanied by unintended weight loss - Nausea - Anemia, which may be associated with fatigue - Gastrointestinal bleeding, evidenced by blood in the stool or vomit - Bloating or a feeling of fullness  2. Natural History:  Peptic ulcers are a chronic condition that, if left untreated, can lead to complications such as bleeding, perforation, and blockage of the stomach. Once present, ulcers can recur and persist over many years. Treatment often leads to healing of the ulcer, but without addressing the underlying cause (like eliminating H. pylori or stopping NSAIDs), recurrence is common.  3. Epidemiology:  Peptic ulcers affect millions of people each year. They are more common in older adults who use NSAIDs regularly or who are infected with H. pylori. However, ulcers can occur in individuals of any age, including children.  4. Etiology:  Peptic ulcers occur when acid in the digestive tract erodes the inner surface of the stomach or small intestine. The acid can create a painful open sore that may bleed. The two most common causes of peptic ulcers are:  - Infection with the bacterium Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) - Long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin and ibuprofen  5. Pathophysiology:  Peptic ulcers develop when there's an imbalance between the stomach's aggressive factors, such as acid and pepsin, and defensive factors, such as mucus, bicarbonate, and blood flow to the mucosa. The imbalance leads to inflammation, mucosal damage, and ulceration.  6. Differential Diagnosis:  The differential diagnosis for peptic ulcer disease includes:  - GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) - Gastritis - Gastric or esophageal cancer - IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) - Gallbladder disease  7.

Pathophysiology:  Peptic ulcers develop when there's an imbalance between the stomach's aggressive factors, such as acid and pepsin, and defensive factors, such as mucus, bicarbonate, and blood flow to the mucosa. The imbalance leads to inflammation, mucosal damage, and ulceration.  6. Differential Diagnosis:  The differential diagnosis for peptic ulcer disease includes:  - GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) - Gastritis - Gastric or esophageal cancer - IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) - Gallbladder disease  7. Risk factor/predisposing factor   H.pylori infection and long-term use of NSAIDs are major risk factors. Other factors include smoking, alcohol use, and having a relative with the disease.  8. Previous Medical History:  A history of H. pylori infection or long-term NSAID use can predispose an individual to peptic ulcers. Other factors that can increase the risk include:  - Age: Older adults are more likely to develop peptic ulcers. - Tobacco use: Smoking may increase the risk of peptic ulcers in people who are infected with H. pylori. - Other medical conditions: Liver, kidney or lung disease, among other conditions, can increase the risk of PUD."," A 70-year-old woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis and chronic kidney disease reports experiencing persistent upper abdominal pain.

Natural History:  The natural history of PBC varies widely. Some individuals may remain asymptomatic and have a normal life expectancy, while others may develop symptoms and complications over time. Without treatment, progressive liver damage can lead to cirrhosis, liver failure, and associated complications.  3. Epidemiology:  PBC primarily affects middle-aged women, with a female to male ratio of about 9:1. It is estimated to affect 20-40 per 100,000 adults in the western world.  4. Etiology:  The exact cause of PBC is unknown. It's believed to be a multifactorial disease, possibly triggered by a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors. It is considered an autoimmune disease, where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy cells in the liver.  5. Pathophysiology:  The pathophysiology of PBC involves chronic inflammation of the intrahepatic bile ducts, leading to their destruction.

It is considered an autoimmune disease, where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy cells in the liver.  5. Pathophysiology:  The pathophysiology of PBC involves chronic inflammation of the intrahepatic bile ducts, leading to their destruction. This results in cholestasis, or reduced bile flow, which can cause damage to the liver cells (hepatocytes) and eventually lead to fibrosis and cirrhosis.  6. Differential Diagnosis:  Differential diagnosis should include other causes of cholestasis such as primary sclerosing cholangitis, autoimmune hepatitis, drug-induced liver injury, and infiltrative diseases of the liver.  7. Risk factor/predisposing factor  Risk factors aren't well understood but may include genetic predisposition, environmental factors, and autoimmune diseases. It's more common in women and those with a family history of the disease.  8.

They may include:  - Abdominal pain, typically in the upper left quadrant - Fever - Chills - Nausea and vomiting - Diarrhea  - Fatigue or general malaise - Left shoulder pain due to referred pain (Kehr's sign)  For splenic abscess specifically, patients may also have signs of sepsis if the infection spreads.  2. Natural History:  Without treatment, splenic infarction or abscess can potentially lead to life-threatening complications such as rupture of the spleen and sepsis. However, with appropriate treatment, the prognosis can be quite good.  3. Epidemiology:  Both splenic infarction and abscess are relatively rare. Splenic infarctions occur in approximately 0.1-0.2% of patients undergoing abdominal CT scans, and splenic abscesses represent less than 0.2% of all abscesses.  4. Etiology:  Splenic infarction is usually caused by conditions that lead to a reduction or blockage of blood supply to the spleen, such as blood clots or sickle cell disease. Splenic abscesses are typically caused by an infection that has spread to the spleen, often from another location in the body, or following splenic trauma or splenic infarction.  5. Pathophysiology:  In a splenic infarction, a disruption to the blood supply of the spleen leads to tissue death. This can be due to a clot in the blood vessels that supply the spleen, or as a result of conditions that lead to reduced blood flow.  A splenic abscess occurs when an infection enters the spleen, resulting in pus formation within the splenic tissue. This can occur via hematogenous spread of bacteria, direct spread from nearby infection, or following splenic injury or infarction.  6. Differential Diagnosis:  Conditions that could be considered in differential diagnosis include acute pancreatitis, left lower lobe pneumonia, kidney stones, gastric ulcers, or myocardial infarction, among others.   7. Risk factor/predisposing factor   Risk factors include conditions that increase the risk of blood clots, such as sickle cell disease or certain other blood disorders, cancers, and certain infections like bacterial endocarditis.  8.

Splenic infarctions occur in approximately 0.1-0.2% of patients undergoing abdominal CT scans, and splenic abscesses represent less than 0.2% of all abscesses.  4. Etiology:  Splenic infarction is usually caused by conditions that lead to a reduction or blockage of blood supply to the spleen, such as blood clots or sickle cell disease. Splenic abscesses are typically caused by an infection that has spread to the spleen, often from another location in the body, or following splenic trauma or splenic infarction.  5. Pathophysiology:  In a splenic infarction, a disruption to the blood supply of the spleen leads to tissue death. This can be due to a clot in the blood vessels that supply the spleen, or as a result of conditions that lead to reduced blood flow.  A splenic abscess occurs when an infection enters the spleen, resulting in pus formation within the splenic tissue. This can occur via hematogenous spread of bacteria, direct spread from nearby infection, or following splenic injury or infarction.  6. Differential Diagnosis:  Conditions that could be considered in differential diagnosis include acute pancreatitis, left lower lobe pneumonia, kidney stones, gastric ulcers, or myocardial infarction, among others.   7. Risk factor/predisposing factor   Risk factors include conditions that increase the risk of blood clots, such as sickle cell disease or certain other blood disorders, cancers, and certain infections like bacterial endocarditis.  8. Any Previous Medical History that is related to the disease:  Previous medical history that might increase the risk of splenic infarction or abscess could include conditions like sickle cell disease, endocarditis, or other conditions associated with an increased risk of blood clots. Other risk factors could include a history of trauma to the spleen, or a history of immune-compromising conditions or procedures, such as chemotherapy or organ transplantation."," A 65-year-old man presents with severe left upper quadrant pain, fever, and chills.

674,"Splenic Infarction or Abscess  1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:  Symptoms of splenic infarction or abscess can vary greatly, depending on the severity of the condition. They may include:  - Abdominal pain, typically in the upper left quadrant - Fever - Chills - Nausea and vomiting - Diarrhea  - Fatigue or general malaise - Left shoulder pain due to referred pain (Kehr's sign)  For splenic abscess specifically, patients may also have signs of sepsis if the infection spreads.  2.
